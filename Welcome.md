# David's Workshop

GitHub is the land of misfits who eventually create something useful enough it is removed from the hard drive and shared with the world. This my repository of work that I'd like to share. I've got random models, automation techniques, machine learning and AI programs, and anything else I cook up that interest me. I have a wide range of interest from game theory and behavioral economics to politics and avoiding repetitive tasks. 

Enjoy the page and take what you like!
